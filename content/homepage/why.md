A wide range of organisations, scientists, water, climate, health, and environmental experts, along with many more people, are campaigning to halt mining at Russell Vale. For example, Wollongong City Council opposes the project due to community concerns that have been raised. 

These threats include risks to drinking water catchment, local ecosystems, Aboriginal heritage sites, Wollongong Coalâ€™s poor track record on workplace safety, employment conditions, debt servicing and operating compliance as well as increased heavy vehicle traffic, dust, noise, and greenhouse gas emissions.
